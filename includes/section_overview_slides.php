            <h3><span>Overview</span>What is Asthma?</h3>
            <p>Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases and has been recognized as a growing public health concern. The effects of asthma include <strong>missed school</strong> and <strong>work days</strong>, disruption of sleep and daily activities, <strong>urgent medical visits</strong> for asthma exacerbations, and even death.</p>

                <p>As with any disease, there are many ways to measure asthma severity in the population. Surveys reveal that about <strong>5 million Californians have asthma</strong>.</p>
                <p>A subset of these sufferers will experience severe uncontrolled symptoms in a given year that cause them to visit a hospital emergency department (ED) for treatment.</p>
                <p>Measuring asthma-related ED visits can reveal the frequency of poorly controlled or severe cases of asthma in the population. Differences in the ED visit rate among different populations can suggest how to target additional investments in asthma care.</p>

                <p>In 2012, there were about <strong>185,831</strong> ED visits for asthma in California, or <strong>49.8 per 10,000</strong> Californians of all ages. The rate for youth aged 0-17 was much higher, with <strong>79.4</strong> ED visits per 10,000 young Californians.</p>
                <p>The state’s Let’s Get Healthy California initiative has set a target of just <strong>28 youth ED visits</strong> for asthma per 10,000 by <strong>2022</strong>. Reaching this goal would represent an over <strong>65%</strong> cut in the youth ED visit rate over the next seven years.</p>
